# Research Objective:
This work aims to further understand robot teams performing tasks in complex unstructured environments. We use stochastic macroscopic modeling to model and control high level team objectives, and provide mappings to microscopic instantiations of robot teams.

The miniature Autonomous Surface Vehicles (mASV) are differential drive robots which use an Arduino Fio, XBee communication, and OptiTrack for global positioning. 
</div>

We experimentally verify our methods using the miniature Autonomous Surface Vehicles (mASVs) which are built in house at the ScALAR lab. Our testing environment is a 4m x 3m x 1.5m tank, equipped with 13 OptiTrack cameras, and the capability to make gyres in the tank. At any given time we can have upwards of 10 mASV in the tank performing different control strategies. Within the tank we have demonstrated heterogeneous teams using Crazyflie robots and mASV simultaneously.

This video shows mixed reality trials with 4 real miniature Autonomous Surface Vehicles (mASV) and 6 simulated robots. The result is a robot team performing different tasks (red, blue, or green lights) where the distributions change over time without changing the model parameters or re-planning.

Our recent work presented at DARS uses a nonlinear stochastic model to achieve time-varying distributions of robots which was a limitation of previous linear stochastic models. Our results suggest further work is needed to understand how macroscopic models can better incorporate feedback from the environment.
