Inspired by my advisor's family tradition, my partner and I build our own mechatronic ginger bread house.

We used this [Gingerbread recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_make_a_gingerbread_house/) and I liked it a lot! Very stable and delicious! I used 1/8th of an inch thick gingerbread.I did not like my royal icing recipe, it was not as stable. I think I needed to add more egg whites. All in all we were very happy with the outcome and the entire structure moved which was a big accomplishment for us!

The paper model I made did not account for the thickness of the gingerbread which I rolled out to 1/4th of an inch. So the structure was a bit wonky. I also did not love how this gingerbread tasted (it was awhile ago so I do not remember what recipe I used). The structure lasted us a long time and brought us a lot of joy!
