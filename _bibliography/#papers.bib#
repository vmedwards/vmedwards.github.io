  abstract={Swarms of coupled mobile agents subject to inter-agent wireless communication delays are known to exhibit multiple dynamic patterns in space that depend on the strength of the interactions and the magnitude of the communication delays. We experimentally demonstrate communication delay-induced bifurcations in the spatio-temporal patterns of robot swarms using two distinct hardware platforms in a mixed reality framework. Additionally, we make steps toward experimentally validating theoretically predicted parameter regions where transitions between swarm patterns occur. We show that multiple rotation patterns persist even when collision-avoidance strategies are incorporated, and we show the existence of multi-stable, co-existing rotational patterns not predicted by usual mean field dynamics. Our experiments are the first significant steps towards validating existing theory and the existence and robustness of the delay-induced patterns in real robotic swarms.},

  title={Stochastic nonlinear ensemble modeling and control for robot team environmental monitoring},
  author={Edwards, Victoria and Silva, Thales C and  Hsieh, M Ani},
  abstract={We seek methods to model, control, and analyze robot teams performing environmental monitoring tasks. During environmental monitoring, the goal is to have teams of robots collect various data throughout a fixed region for extended periods of time. Standard bottom-up task assignment methods do not scale as the number of robots and task locations increases and require computationally expensive replanning. Alternatively, top-down methods have been used to combat computational complexity, but most have been limited to the analysis of methods which focus on transition times between tasks. In this work, we study a class of nonlinear macroscopic models which we use to control a time varying distribution of robots performing different tasks throughout an environment. Our proposed ensemble model and control maintains desired time varying populations of robots by leveraging naturally occurring interactions between robots performing tasks. We validate our approach at multiple fidelity levels including experimental results, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach to perform environmental monitoring.},
