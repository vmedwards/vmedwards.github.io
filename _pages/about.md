I am an experimental roboticist working at the intersection of Robotics, Complex Systems Theory and Dynamical Systems Theory.
I have interests in the full range of multi robot systems, including robot teams with sophisticated capabilities and coordinated task strategies, as well as large scale collectives demonstrating emergent behavior.
Throughout my research I have experimented with unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs).
In the future, it will be important to use heterogeneous robot teams to capture data at different space and times scales.
My research objective is to combine environment models with models from Complex Systems theory to control robot teams monitoring dynamic environments.
Throughout my dissertation I have made contributions to solving the multi robot task allocation problem demonstrating the power of complex systems theory for analyzing robotic systems to enable increased scalability and flexibility for operating in uncertain and  dynamic environments. 
Overall, two themes emerge in my research.

1) How do we design and coordinate multi robot systems to perform missions in uncertain and dynamic environments? and

2) How do we use robot teams to help understand natural phenomena, e.g., changing water temperatures.

I hope to increase the capability of multi robot systems to help improve our climate resiliency.
