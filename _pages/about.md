I am an experimental roboticist working at the intersection of Robotics, Complex Systems Theory and Dynamical Systems Theory.
I have interests in the full range of multi robot systems, including robot teams with sophisticated capabilities and coordinated task strategies, as well as large scale collectives demonstrating emergent behavior.
Throughout my research I have experimented with unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs).
To increase our understanding of ongoing environmental changes, it will be important to use heterogeneous robot teams to capture data at different space and times scales.
My research objective is to combine environment models with models from Complex Systems theory to control robot teams monitoring dynamic environments.
Throughout my dissertation, I have made contributions to solving the multi robot task allocation problem for robot teams deployed in dynamic environments.
Our results demonstrate the power of complex systems theory for analyzing robotic systems to enable increased scalability and flexibility for operating in uncertain and  dynamic environments. 
Overall, two themes emerge in my research.

1) How do we design and coordinate multi robot systems to perform missions in uncertain and dynamic environments? and

2) How do we use robot teams to help understand natural phenomena, e.g., changing water temperatures.

I hope increasing the capability of multi robot systems results in tools that can contribute to improving our climate resiliency.

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics Department (MEAM).
I work in the Scalable Autonomous Robotics Lab with Dr. Ani Hsieh as a member of the GRASP Lab.
Prior to my PhD I was a Karles Fellow working as an Autonomous Systems Scientist at the US Naval Research Lab.
I recieved my Masters of Science in Robotics from the University of Michigan, and I recieved my Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colby College. 
When I am not working to improve robot teams you can find me walking my corgi, knitting, or baking cakes.
